## Project Notes

## Keycast Multi-Provider Architecture - The Full Vision

**Key Insight:** Keycast is NOT just a single service - it's an **open-source server-based signing protocol** that anyone can run. Think "email providers" model for Nostr keys.

**Planned Instances:**
- `login.divine.video` - Main instance for divine.video
- `auth.protest.net` - Separate instance for protest.net
- Anyone else can run their own Keycast server

**The Flow (Server-based KMS signing):**
1. User visits any Nostr app with keycast-login integration
2. Modal shows: "Sign in with Keycast" + list of providers
3. User picks provider (divine.video, protest.net, or custom)
4. Email/password registration on that provider
5. Provider generates key, encrypts with KMS, stores it
6. Provider's signer daemon handles all signing via NIP-46
7. User gets instant, automatic signing with no prompts

**Secondary Flow (Existing Nostr users):**
- "Already have Nostr?" → Use extension/nsec.app/other bunkers
- Standard nostr-login behavior for these users

**Why This is Brilliant:**
- Decentralized: Anyone can run a Keycast instance
- User choice: Pick your provider like picking email provider
- Better UX: No browser extensions, no manual bunker URLs
- Always available: Server signing means no "user offline" issues
- Team support: Shared keys with individual session tracking

**Current Status:**
- Backend works: Registration, KMS storage, signer daemon all functional
- Discovery endpoint working: Returns NIP-46 config
- Need: Fork nostr-login to make Keycast providers the primary flow
- Need: Fix connect endpoint to work with registered users (not just demo keys)

**Next Decision:** Fork nostr-login first, or fix backend connect flow first?
